Extended Euclidean Algorithm to save you some work in math class.

Form: gcd(m, n) = a*m + b*n

"Extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the Euclidean algorithm. In addition to 
the greatest common divisor (gcd) of integers m and n, it also computes the coefficients of 
BÃ©zout's identity, which are integers a and b."
